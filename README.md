molokai-dark theme for Vim
==========================

Molokai-dark is a darker and re-worked version of the [Molokai theme by @tomasr](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai).

It uses a completely black background to increase the contrast between background and text.

256-color terminals are fully supported with only minor differences from the full-color version.

Setup
-----
Install it via your preferred Vim plugin installation method and configure it in your `~/.vimrc`:
```vim
colorscheme molokai-dark
```

Options
-------
Spelling errors and [Syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic/) issues will attempt to
use colored underlines to show issues. If colored underlines are not supported then there is a
fallback that also changes the background color of the text.

The theme assumes that if you are running a gui like `gvim` it will support colored underlines but
if you're running `vim` in a terminal, it will not. These assumptions can be changed by setting the
following variables in your `~/.vimrc` (defaults shown):

```vim
let g:molokaidark_undercolor_gui = 1
let g:molokaidark_undercolor_cterm = 0

colorscheme molokai-dark
```
